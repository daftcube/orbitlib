# Installation

## Using a Standard Studio Workflow

First, install the [latest release](https://github.com/daftcube/orbitlib/releases). Create a folder in the location of installation (recommended: install in ReplicatedStorage or ServerScriptService). Then, create a ModuleScript for each `.lua` file in the latest release. Copy the contents from each `.lua` file to its respective module. 

## Using a Rojo Workflow

Simply download the [latest release](https://github.com/daftcube/orbitlib/releases) and drag it into a location where it can be accessed by other scripts.
